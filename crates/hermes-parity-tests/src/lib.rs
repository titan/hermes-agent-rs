//! # hermes-parity-tests
//!
//! Week 0 **parity proof chain**: JSON fixtures (recorded from or verified against
//! Python `research/hermes-agent` — baseline tag tracked in `PYTHON_BASELINE.txt`)
//! plus a small harness that runs the **Rust** implementation and compares outputs.
//!
//! - Fixture layout: `fixtures/<logical_module>/*.json`
//! - Schema: see [`harness::ParityFixtureFile`]
//! - Recording: `scripts/record_fixtures.py` (requires local Python checkout)
